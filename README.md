# ‚òÅÔ∏è MyCloud

**MyCloud** is a portfolio-scale project that reimagines core AWS services with open-source tools.
It‚Äôs not meant to replace AWS ‚Äî but to **learn, explore, and demonstrate distributed systems design** while giving developers free, local *cloud-like* infrastructure.

üß© **Core Services:** EC2 ¬∑ S3 ¬∑ RDS ¬∑ IAM ¬∑ Lambda

üõ†Ô∏è **Stack:** Go ¬∑ Docker ¬∑ Redis ¬∑ NATS ¬∑ PostgreSQL ¬∑ Traefik

üîÑ **Event Bus:** Built with **NATS**, wrapped in an abstraction layer so all services can publish and subscribe without coupling ‚Äî forming the ‚Äúnervous system‚Äù of MyCloud.

üéÑ **Goal:** Build it all before Christmas.

Just learning how the cloud actually works ‚Äî one service at a time.

> ‚ÄúThe best way to understand the cloud is not to build your own small one.‚Äù ‚òÅÔ∏è





Yes ‚Äî it‚Äôs ambitious, but it‚Äôs **absolutely possible**. What you‚Äôre describing is essentially **a full industrial-grade object storage + distributed persistence engine with integrated semantic search**. Let me break this down carefully.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Vision

You want a **real, production-grade S3-like system** that has:

1. **Durable object storage**:

   * WAL-backed metadata DB
   * Multiple storage sidecars (Disk, NAS, Distributed nodes, MinIO backup) working in **parallel for durability and HA**

2. **High availability & scalability**:

   * Writes replicated to multiple nodes
   * Recovery from crashes via WAL replay
   * Metadata centralized in a fast key-value store (Badger, RocksDB, etc.)

3. **Semantic search**:

   * Each object (or selected objects) is **vectorized** and stored in a **vector database**
   * Allows searching by content, embedding similarity, or metadata queries

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How Semantic Search Fits

### Step-by-step:

1. **Object ingestion**:

   * Client uploads a file (PUT /bucket/object)
   * WAL logs the operation
   * Sidecars save to Disk, NAS, Distributed nodes, and MinIO (parallel writes)

2. **Vectorization**:

   * A **worker (vectorizer)** reads the object content:

     * Text ‚Üí NLP embeddings (OpenAI embeddings, Sentence Transformers, etc.)
     * Images ‚Üí vision embeddings
     * Audio ‚Üí audio embeddings
   * Embeddings are written to a **vector database** (e.g., Milvus, Weaviate, or Pinecone)

3. **Metadata link**:

   * Vector database stores reference to object (bucket + key)
   * Metadata DB still keeps standard info (size, checksum, version)

4. **Querying**:

   * User sends a **semantic query**: e.g., ‚Äúfind all invoices mentioning project X‚Äù
   * Query converted to embedding ‚Üí vector DB returns closest matches
   * API layer resolves object location ‚Üí returns files

```

* **Parallel writes**: Disk, NAS, Distributed, MinIO backup
* **WAL ensures durability & atomicity**
* **Vector worker asynchronously generates embeddings** for semantic search
* **Metadata DB** keeps object state, versioning, permissions

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Feasibility Notes

1. **Yes, it‚Äôs doable**, but it‚Äôs a **high-complexity project**.
2. **Embedding all objects** will require CPU/GPU resources depending on content type.
3. **Vector DB integration**:

   * Milvus, Weaviate, Pinecone, Qdrant ‚Üí can store high-dimensional embeddings
   * Can integrate with your Golang stack via gRPC or REST API
4. **Asynchronous design** is key:

   * Writes ‚Üí WAL + sidecars ‚Üí return success
   * Vectorization ‚Üí async worker ‚Üí update vector DB
5. **Scale**:

   * Metadata DB should be fast and durable
   * Vector DB can be distributed for large-scale semantic search

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Advantages of This Setup

* **Industrial durability**: WAL + multi-sidecar writes = low risk of data loss
* **High performance**: Parallelism of sidecars + async embedding
* **Extensible**: Can add new sidecars for replication, compression, encryption, or new storage backends
* **Semantic search**: Adds value beyond traditional S3, making objects **intelligently searchable**

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps

If you want, I can create a **concrete Golang architecture** for this system showing:

* WAL engine
* Parallel sidecar workers for Disk, NAS, Distributed nodes, MinIO backup
* Metadata DB integration
* Vectorization worker for semantic search
* API layer to tie it all together

This would give you a **real industrial-grade blueprint**, not a toy system ‚Äî exactly what you‚Äôre envisioning.

Do you want me to do that next?
